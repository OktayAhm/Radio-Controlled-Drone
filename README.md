# Radio-Controlled-Drone

Project Overview
This project involved the design and construction of a radio-controlled drone with a focus on integrating various hardware and software components to achieve functional and reliable wireless communication and control. The project was structured around the assembly of three main PCBs: two dedicated to the transceiver and one serving as the flight controller.

Key Features
Transceiver and Flight Controller PCBs: Schematic design, layout, and manufacturing of essential PCBs to ensure effective communication between the transmitter and receiver.
Drone Construction: A combination of 3D mechanical design and hardware integration, where all necessary components were connected and tested for operational efficiency.
Programming and Testing: Development and debugging of microcontroller programming followed by comprehensive testing phases to refine the drone's operation.
Documentation: Continuous documentation throughout the project lifecycle, detailing the progression and technical specifications.
Technologies Used
NRF24L01 Radio Module: Enabled long-distance communication without signal interruptions.
Arduino and MPU6050: Core components for controlling drone movement and stability.
3D Printing: Utilized for creating custom drone frame components from STL files.
EasyEDA and JLCPCB: Tools for PCB design and manufacturing.
Challenges and Resolutions
Stabilization Issues: Initial flight tests showed stabilization problems; resolved through code optimizations in the flight controller.
Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs): Replaced ineffective ESCs to synchronize motor operations, enhancing the droneâ€™s balance and flight response.
Project Outcomes
The final drone assembly successfully demonstrated the integration of software and hardware capabilities, achieving stable and controlled flight. This project not only provided a deep dive into the intricacies of drone technology but also highlighted critical problem-solving approaches and project management skills.
